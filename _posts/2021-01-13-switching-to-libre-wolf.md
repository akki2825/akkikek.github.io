I have been using mozilla firefox from probably more than half a decade. The recent blog by the Mozilla Org - ["We need more than deplatforming"](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/01/08/we-need-more-than-deplatforming/) is absolutely terrifying! They just want to deplatform the voices they do not like. 


I have been wanting to switch to [LibreWolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/).. and what better time than now.
