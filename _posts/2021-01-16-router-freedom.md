title: "(No) Freedom of Router"
categories: [computer-science]

Router is an equipment used connect to the Internet. I recently switched to Jio broadband and I was forbidden to use the router of my choice. Here I am not only comprimising my freedom of choice but also the Security and Privacy & Data protection.

We can guarantee the right to Internet access only when the users are empowered to use their own equipment to connect to the Internet.

I would like to dig down further into this issue and will try to get help from the Free Software communities in India.
