**Hi! I'm Akhilesh**. I'm a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Practitioner working on Indic languages.

I'm happiest when I'm building computational tools for the processing of a natural language in an environment with motivated people that I can learn from.

I'm self-taught on both Computer Science and Linguistics, and have an engineering degree in Automobile engineering.

I've explored jobs from car mechanic to software engineer, but the majority has been NLP engineer/practitioner at startups.
