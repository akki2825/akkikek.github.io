**Hi!**

**I'm Akhilesh**. I’m a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engineer** working on **Indic languages**. I delight myself in building computational tools for natural language processing.

After earning my Bachelor’s in Automobile Engineering, I have since moved on to teach myself Computer Science and Linguistics.

Much of my interests were shaped through my professional journey, and have since explored jobs from a Car Mechanic to a Software Engineer, but the majority has been NLP engineering in startups.

Having worked with early stage startups most of my career, I have had the opportunity to build on many fronts such as _Machine Translation Systems_, _Voice assistants_, and _Multilingual Chatbots_, and the good fortune of having great managers, colleagues and friends who have helped me enjoy every role so far.


## Jobs
